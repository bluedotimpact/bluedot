# Verifying Work

For each task, follow a "before, during, and after" workflow:

1. **Before:** Confirm the current state and assumptions using available debugging tools, exploring the codebase with search functions, and verifying issues in the browser before making changes.
2. **During:** Make the necessary code changes, continuing the work with high agency and resourcefulness until it is done or reaching a dead end.
3. **After:** Verify the behavior and ensure it matches the changes by running tests, checking logs, and previewing the application in the browser.
