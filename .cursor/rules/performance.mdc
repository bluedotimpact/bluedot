## Performance and Optimization

- **Avoid unnecessary re-renders:** Use React's memoization tools (`useMemo`, `useCallback`, `memo`) for expensive operations or to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

- **Optimize images and assets:** Use appropriate image formats, sizes, and the Next.js Image component to optimize loading performance.

- **Implement proper loading states:** Always handle loading states gracefully with appropriate UI feedback.
