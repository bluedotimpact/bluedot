## Code Organization and Architecture

- **Understand the monorepo structure:** Familiarize yourself with the structure of apps and libraries before making changes. New shared functionality likely belongs in one of the libraries, not duplicated across apps.
  - Libraries (`/libraries/*`) contain shared code used across multiple apps
  - Apps (`/apps/*`) are standalone applications with specific purposes

- **Minimize dependencies:** We prefer "boring technology" - use existing dependencies before adding new ones. If you need to add a new dependency, justify it clearly in your PR description.
  - Always check if the functionality already exists in our codebase or in libraries we're already using

- **Follow TypeScript patterns:** Use proper typing throughout your code. Avoid `any` types and use interfaces/types consistently.
  - Define types/interfaces at the top of your files or in dedicated type files when appropriate
