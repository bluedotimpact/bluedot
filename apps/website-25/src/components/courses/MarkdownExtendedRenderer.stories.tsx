## Images

You can also show images!

![Pale Blue Dot, the first ever portrait of the solar system taken by the Voyager 1 spacecraft](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Pale_Blue_Dot.png)

Code:

\`\`\`mdx

\`\`\`

Tip: To insert an image in the Airtable editor, write text that describe the image that will be used by screenreaders and search engines ([more details](https://accessibility.huit.harvard.edu/describe-content-images)). Then, create a link from that text to the image source. Finally, pop an exclamation mark before the whole thing. It won't render in Airtable, but will in this component.

## Code

Inline: \`const example = "hello world";\`

Block:
\`\`\`javascript
function greet(name) {
  return \`Hello, \${name}!\`;
}
\`\`\`

Code:

\`\`\`\`mdx
Inline: \`const example = "hello world";\`

Block:
\`\`\`javascript
function greet(name) {
  return \`Hello, \${name}!\`;
}
\`\`\`
\`\`\`\`
    `,
  },
};

export const WithComponents: Story = {
  args: {
    children: `# Using Components

The following components are supported within your markdown content:

${Object.keys(getSupportedComponents()).map((componentName) => `- \`${componentName}\``).join('\n')}

See their Storybook pages for usage details.

(to add to this list, add to \`getSupportedComponents\` in \`MarkdownExtendedRenderer.tsx\`)

## Example

Below is an example of using the Callout and Embed components:

<Callout title="Want to see something cool?">
  This is some markdown extended content, using _components_!

  And you can nest components as you like too:

  <Embed url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ" />
</Callout>

Code:

\`\`\`mdx
<Callout title="Want to see something cool?">
  This is some markdown extended content, using _components_!

  And you can nest components as you like too:

  <Embed url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ" />
</Callout>
\`\`\`

## Escaping

Component properties will be unescaped when rendered. For example the input:

\`\`\`mdx
<Embed url="https://example.com/some\\_underscored\\_path" />
\`\`\`

Will actually render the following MDX:

\`\`\`mdx
<Embed url="https://example.com/some_underscored_path" />
\`\`\`

This is because by default most Markdown editors aren't aware of components, and so will escape special markdown characters everywhere - including in component properties. This includes the Airtable markdown editor.

If you do really want backslashes, escape them:

\`\`\`mdx
<Callout title="The backslash symbol (\\\\) is often used to escape other characters" />
\`\`\`

<Callout title="The backslash symbol (\\\\) is often used to escape other characters" />

This only affects components, and not markdown text. So escaping works normally in markdown:

\`\`\`mdx
- _normal italics_
- \\_escaped italics\\_
\`\`\`

- _normal italics_
- \\_escaped italics\\_
`,
  },
};
