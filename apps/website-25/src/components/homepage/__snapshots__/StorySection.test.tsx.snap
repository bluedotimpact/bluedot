            Over the past 2 years, we've supported 2,500 people to learn about AI safety and pandemic preparedness, and our alumni work in critical roles across government and industry. In 2024, we will train ~3x more people than 2023 by running each of our three existing courses every four months (AI Alignment, AI Governance, Pandemics).
