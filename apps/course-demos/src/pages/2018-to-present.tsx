They can also be "entangled," meaning the state of one qubit instantly affects another, no matter the distance between them.\n\nThis allows quantum computers to explore multiple solutions to a problem at once, making them potentially much faster for certain tasks like breaking encryption, simulating molecules for drug discovery, or optimizing complex systems.',
