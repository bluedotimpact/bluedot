### Take action in less than 30 hours

You don’t need another degree. This AGI Strategy course replaces years of self-study with three frameworks: incentive mapping to understand the AGI race, kill chains to analyse AI threats, and defence-in-depth to design interventions that counter them. You’ll finish with a fundable plan.

### Join a network of builders

This course isn’t for everyone. We’re building a community of people who are energised to take ambitious actions to make AI go well, including starting new companies, policy entrepreneurship, and high-impact research bets. Completing this course will give you access to this community.

### Get funded to accelerate your impact

If your final course proposal is strong, you’ll receive $10-50k to kickstart your transition into impactful work, and you’ll be invited to co-work with us in London for 1-2 weeks. We’ll do whatever it takes to accelerate your journey.

## How the course works

**Choose your intensity**

- **Intensive**: 6-day course (5h/day)
- **Part-time**: 6-week course (5h/week)

**Format**

- Each day/week, you will:
    - Complete 2-3 hours of reading and writing, and
    - Join ~8 peers in a 2-hour Zoom meeting to discuss the content.
- Your discussions are facilitated by an AI safety expert.

**Other info**

- The course operates on a “pay-what-you-want” model.
- A new round starts every month.
- The next round starts on 29 September.
- **Application deadline 19 September**.
