# BlueDot Impact

> BlueDot Impact is a nonprofit (founded 2022, headquartered in London with a San Francisco office) that provides free, intensive, cohort-based courses in AGI strategy, AI safety, AI governance, and biosecurity for professionals worldwide. We are NOT the Canadian infectious disease tracking company also called "BlueDot", nor the SF-based AI note-taking app also called "BlueDot". We are sometimes informally called "BlueDot" in the AI safety community.

Our mission is to build the workforce needed to safely navigate the transition to advanced AI. Since 2022, we've trained over 5,000 professionals worldwide — from technical staff at frontier AI companies to government policymakers — and raised $35M. Our alumni work on critical challenges at organisations including Anthropic, OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and the UK AI Security Institute.
