## Pull Request Guidelines

- **Reference issues:** Always link your PR to an issue. If an issue doesn't exist, create one first to discuss the changes.

- **Keep PRs focused:** Each PR should address a single concern. Split large changes into multiple PRs when possible.

- **Descriptive PR titles and descriptions:** Write clear PR titles and descriptions that explain the what, why, and how of your changes.

- **Add appropriate tests:** Add or update tests relevant to your changes. For UI changes, consider adding visual tests.

- **Document new features or APIs:** If adding new functionality, update or create relevant documentation.
